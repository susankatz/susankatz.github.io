        <p> Every year, Wine Enthusiast Magazine complies and publishes reviews on over 24,000 wines across the globe. In each wine in review, a taste specialist provides a descriptive flavor profiling and documents the product's price, grape variety, and place of orgin. These data points are then ultimately used to determine the wine's "scoring", which is based on a 1 to 100 scale. This experience will focus on the 2017 wine reviews.  </p>
